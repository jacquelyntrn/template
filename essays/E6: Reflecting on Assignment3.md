<b>Briefly describe your system (e.g. A store selling Pokemon game cards)</b>
My website is store that sells any matcha related type of food. It mostly consists of desserts because matcha pretty bitter.

<b>Any notable shortcomings, bugs, problems, or additional features not implemented?</b>
I had not been able to add the emailing feature. I never really did combine the login and the shopping cart well. It wasn't stored in a working manner in a json or the server. It doesn't keep track of users, user information, or their products.

<b>Describe what you are most proud of about your system:</b>
I think the layout is what I'm most proud of. I really like the design of the template and working of it. 

<b>Describe what you are least happy with your system:</b>
I'm least happy with making my website function properly.

<b>How was developing this assignment different than assignment #2?</b>
This assignment was a lot harder to follow because there was so many more ways to approach our website.

<b>When you ran into a problem, what did you do to address it?</b>
Whenever there was a problem, I would test the examples on my own browser and try to understand what each part of the code makes it work. From there, I would try to apply it to my own.

<b>Describe what worked well in doing this assignment?</b>
I think that the self developing navigation bar with the catergories of all the items worked really well.

<b>Describe what did not work well in doing this assignment?</b>
Displaying what was in the shopping cart did not work well for me in this assignment.

<b>What did you learn from doing this assignment?</b>
I learned that coding is a really large project that needs to be approached as a project and not just like any tedious work. It really takes a lot of time and lot of steps.

<b>If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you change?</b>
I would try to better understand the server because at many points, I didn't understand what the server was doing.

<b>Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging<b>
I had prepared for the assignment starting early which took me about 5 hours. Then, when I got to the actual coding, it was late, and I was struggling a lot more than I anticipated and spent about 20 hours over two days trying to work it out.
